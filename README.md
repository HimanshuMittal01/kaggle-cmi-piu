Inspired by the [CCDS](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/using-the-template/#open-a-notebook) template, the prefix for each notebook in the `notebooks/` directory represents a phase:
- `0` - Load, view and understand data
- `1` - Data cleaning and feature engineering
- `2` - Model training, evaluation and inference
- `3` - Serves as reports
