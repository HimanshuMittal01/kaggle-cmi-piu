Insights:
- Using Total_PCIAT as target gives better CV score than using sii however it seems to overfit and hence using sii is performing better on LB
- Using Fitness Duration theoritically sounds good but looks like only test mins would influence it.
- Binning CGAS score is good because there are peaks at multiple of 5.
